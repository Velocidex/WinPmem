and don't forget to set the testsigning on (and reboot).

Known issues: 
* iospace method on Hyper-V VM using the latest Win10 build (but not old Win10 builds) will fail. The other methods should work. Iospace method should work on latest Win10 on machines with no Hyper-V layer.
* PTE works only for x64, not x86.
* Microsoft bug/glitch: on Hyper-V, the longer a VM runs with the "Dynamic memory" feature enabled, the more fragmentation occurs on the memory range runs. (Up to a thousands).

Works:
* everything else.

Report as issue:
* All glitches and bugs not already listed (but not caring about Python yet).

WARNING: do not use this version in your python projects yet! The interface may change at any moment. 

Reminders:
* Don't forget "bcdedit /set testsigning on"
* Disable memory compression and use older Win10 builds or Win7 if you intend to load the dump into Volatility 2.
