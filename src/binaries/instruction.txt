Place your compiled driver binaries here:

1) "winpmem_x64.sys" 
2) "winpmem_x86.sys" 

And then compile the usermode ("mini tool") executable. The executable will then contain both driver files after compilation.

Don't forget 
* bcdedit /set testsigning on & reboot
* memory compression off for Volatility(?)
