Place your compiled driver binaries in "binaries" folder with these names:

1) "winpmem_x64.sys" 
2) "winpmem_x86.sys" 

Then compile the usermode ("mini tool") executable. The executable will then contain both driver files after compilation.

You can also edit the winpmem.rc to use the old icon.

Don't forget 
* bcdedit /set testsigning on & reboot
* memory compression off for Volatility(?)
