(20. Nov  2022, 2.0.2 *Alpha*)

Compile latest source code (2.0.2 *Alpha*) in two steps: 

1. mc log_message.mc
This generates three files needed for eventlog writing: log_message.rc, log_message.h, and MSG00001.bin.
(This step is also described at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/defining-custom-error-types , "Compiling the Error Message Text File")

2. msbuild /p:configuration=Release/Debug /p:platform=Win32/x64 winpmem.vcxproj, or use VS. 
Build environment must be configured for kernel driver compilation.

Installing: 

Do not expect a new compiled release with a signed driver again, although this might be possible in future.
You could use testsigning, and load the driver with any suitable tool.

Works: Win7, (Win8), Win10, Win10 22H2, (2.0.2 not tested with core isolation, 2.0.1 worked). Win11 should work (untested).

Limitations:

* WinXP fell off the support, because of NX allocations (and other pitfalls). Archaeologists will need to adapt the source code first. 
* IOspace method on Hyper-V VM using Win10 might fail. There was a bug with KD and Hyper-V.
* PTE method has been implemented only for x64.
* Microsoft bug/glitch: on Hyper-V, the longer a VM runs with the "Dynamic memory" feature enabled, the more fragmentation occurs on the memory range runs. (Up to a thousands). We cannot fix that.

Works:
* everything else. Report bugs if you find one.
